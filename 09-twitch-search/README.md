## Details

### Deliverables

* A project forked from the [`09-twitch-search` Repository](https://github.com/tiy-tn-fee-2016-summer/09-twitch-search)

### Requirements

Make all tests pass by implementing and filling in the functions.

## Getting Started Tasks

```

## Explorer Difficulty

## Easy Difficulty

For this and the next difficulty, you'll be recreating the game directory page on Twitch.
